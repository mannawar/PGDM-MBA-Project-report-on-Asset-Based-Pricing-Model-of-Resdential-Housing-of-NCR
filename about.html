Abstract

This study is based to inspect the ability to predict housing prices is important such that investors can make better asset allocation decisions, including the pricing and underwriting of the mortgage. The study intends to explore the possibility of modelling housing price based on Asset-based.  Asset pricing theory all stems from one simple concept: price equals expected discounted payoff (rent). The model assumes an association among user cost UCt, the house selling prices, Pt, and the rents Rt
 
 
In this project, first, the data is collected online (Google Doc) via a self-administered questionnaire through the real estate investors in Delhi/NCR and have stored dataset in the database of MS-Access. The dataset has fifteen variables, with twelve analysis variables, which were of both types: qualitative and quantitative. The study was intended to find the relationship of the independent variable (Indicative price) with the dependent variables such as Payoff (Rent), Annual Maintenance Cost and the expected rental increase. 
 
 The data was analyzed using CRISP approach. The result was analyzed statistically, to come up to the conclusion that Asset-Based Models can be applied in the case of NCR properties.  
 
The Algorithm has been built in R-Script, and the Model is compared between the two, Simple Multiple Linear Regression and Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression and the results were compared.

1.0 A Macro-Economic Snapshot of Residential Housing Market of NCR
1.	Introduction to the Housing Market
The residential real estate industry in India is complex and dynamic. Varying economic and demographic characteristics across the country result in differences in the housing markets in different cities. The real-estate industry is inextricably linked to socio-economic growth and development. Increasing the availability and affordability of housing can improve the quality of life for citizens, and the overall development of infrastructure improves productivity within the economy. House prices also indirectly impact macroeconomic health through the wealth effect: as house prices rise, homeowners feel wealthier and are likely to increase consumption and boost aggregate demand (Calomiris, Longhofer, & William, 2012).
 
Housing prices have declined by 7 per cent in the national capital region (NCR) and by 2 per cent in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in the last year, indicating the tepid residential market for the sector reeling under the worst ever slowdown (Business Today, 2019). The year 2018 showed a recovery for the residential sector, with both sales and new supply, gradually reviving across the top 7 Indian cities - Bengaluru, National Capital Region (NCR), Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and Hyderabad (NHB, 2018). The year 2018 has brought about a welcome change to the staggering NCR residential market. On one hand, the market witnessed cautious and strategic new launches under the watchful eye of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, while on the other green shoots of recovery were seen on the demand side with sales numbers faring well in 2018, indicating a slight revival of confidence in the market.
 
 
New launches in NCR registered a 35% growth in the number of units launched in 2018, with approximately 75% of the newly launched units falling in Gurugram and Greater Noida. The market saw approximately 15,819 units launched in 2018 compared to 11,726 units in 2017.
Gurugram contributed significantly to the new launches in NCR in H2 2018, taking up 52% of the overall pie, followed by Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. While previously, Gurugram saw new launches in the affordable housing category, the period of H2 2018 had notable developers launching new projects in the above ` 7.5 mn price bracket. New launches in Noida and Greater Noida have also registered a slight revival in 2018 with developers launching new projects majorly in sector 150 in Noida and Sectors 1, 10, Pari Chowk and Zeta 1 in Greater Noida.
 
Accumulating inventory, debt laden prominent developers and delayed projects in locations such as Greater Noida west, and Noida Greater Noida Expressway has put pressure on the developers to complete projects in hand than launch new ones.
 Weighted average prices in the NCR residential market have registered a marginal 2% increase over H2 2017, which effectively translates into a stagnant market. The market has seen a slowdown in prices since 2013 and the scenario has not changed ever since. Low investor interest and an inventory overhang of more than one lakh units have kept the developers cautious of increasing the prices. On the demand side, sales have started to look up in 2018. On a yearly comparison, approximately 40,646 units were sold in NCR in 2018,
registering a growth of 8% over the 2017 sales numbers. The second half of 2018 registered a 10% growth over the same period in 2017 and helped propel the uptick in sales. Our survey suggests that properties that are ready-to-move or are nearing completion are garnering more enquiries from buyers. This can be attributed factors such as policy intervention in the form of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, which has renewed the developer interest to finish projects at hand rather than launch new ones. Another factor is that the buyer is still not out of the woods and does not want to risk buying an under-construction project.
Greater Noida yet again takes the lion’s share of the demand in 2018 with 50% of the overall sales coming from this affordable micro-market, which is distantly followed by Ghaziabad
and Gurugram at 19% and 17%, respectively. Majority of the projects in Greater Noida is in the less than 5 mn price bracket and are driving demand in this market. Regardless of having no major employment pull, the micro-market is not only attractive to buyers of Noida and Greater Noida but also adjacent tier II cities of Uttar Pradesh such as Mathura, Agra andAligarh due to its affordability. The second half of 2018 fared well for the Greater Noida market with a more than 100% growth in sales in H2 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.
Demand in Gurugram has somewhat remained tepid in 2018. Our survey findings suggest that even though there are increased enquires, certain infrastructure delays such as the Dwarka Expressway is holding back interested buyers who are majorly end users. Another factor contributing to this sluggish demand is that the fresh inventory with builders is in direct competition with the inventory lying with investors who are ready to take a hit and exit the property.

Demand in Noida has also failed to impress in H2 2018. The market registers a YoY 26% decrease in sales compared to H2 2017, market sentiments remain lukewarm.
 
The quarters to sell unsold inventory (QTS) is the number of quarters required to exhaust the existing unsold inventory in the market. The existing unsold inventory is divided by the average sales velocity of the preceding eight quarters to arrive at the QTS number for that particular quarter. A lower QTS indicates a healthier market. Yet again Ghaziabad and Greater Noida emerge as NCR’s better-performing markets, with a QTS of 13 quarters, closely followed by Noida at 14 and Gurugram at 18 quarters. The steady pace of sales and cautious new launches have consequently brought down the unsold inventory by 15% in H2 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The unsold inventory stands at approximately 142,007 units as of December 2018. Greater Noida and Gurugram account for approximately 65% of the unsold inventory in NCR followed by Ghaziabad and Noida
 
Greater Noida led sales in 2018. 50% of the total sales in NCR came from this affordable micro-market. The market is not only attractive to buyers of Noida and Greater Noida but also, adjacent tier-II cities of Uttar Pradesh such as Mathura, Agra and Aligarh due to its affordability (Knight Frank, India, 2018)
 
1.1 Proposal to be investigated
It is widely acknowledged that the value of a house is the mixture of many characteristics. House price prediction thus presents a unique set of challenges in practice.
The homebuyers are mostly concerned with ups and downs of housing prices. During the long process of comparison many buyers might miss the opportunity to buy due to rise in house prices. Also, since houses change hand relatively infrequently, it becomes necessary to predict the value of house between the sales. These predicted values are used for many purposes including second mortgages and homeowner’s insurance. 
The asset-pricing model of house prices provides an intuitive method to connect the cost of owning housing units to rents through introducing the concept of user cost, which by definition is comprised of depreciation cost of the housing unit, maintenance fees, mortgage interest payment, and the capital gains from the housing asset. 
The analysis of the determinants of housing prices is important because of the housing impact on economic and social factors. Firstly, homeownership has a positive effect on residential mobility, resident’s health and other social consequences (DIETZ et al., 2003).
Secondly, housing is a good, which is closely connected with other markets and the whole economic status of the country. As houses can be purchased by the mortgages as well as the own funds of the residents; the housing market is especially related to financial sector (JUREVIČIENĖ; OKUNEVIČIŪTĖ; NEVERAUSKIENĖ, 2008).
Finally, the changes in housing prices influence the construction market and other economic variables such as unemployment and inflation (AZBAINIS, 2014).
1.2 Significance of the Problem
The principle underlying an asset-based approach to welfare is that, rather than relying on state-managed social transfers to counter the risks of poverty, individuals accept greater responsibility for their own welfare needs by investing in financial products and property assets which augment in value over time. These can, at least in theory, later be tapped to supplement consumption and welfare needs when income is reduced, for example, in retirement, or used to acquire other forms of investment such as educational qualifications. (John Doling Richard Ronald, 2010)
1.3 Objectives and the Scope of the Study
The ability to predict housing prices is important such that investors can make better asset allocation decisions, including the pricing and underwriting of mortgages. And therefore, the prime objective of this study is:
•	The study aims to investigate the determinants of asset-based housing Pricing Model.
•	A Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression Model is employed for predicting the asset-based price.
•	The price estimate would further be analysed in terms of possible economic rental gain.
Thus, the objective of this research is to inform an effective investment pathway for social housing.
The data for this study is collected through the primary method. A self-administered structured questionnaire will be prepared, and the response will be collected online through Google Doc from the Property Buyers of NCR location only.
The quantitative variables are presented in summary statistics-mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum. The categorical variables (nominal) will have frequencies and percentages. All test statistical tests will be two-tailed, tested at α=5% level of significance. The data summary would be presented in statistical tables, as obtained from R-Script. Suitable graphs will be used to help aid in statistical reporting using ggplot in R.
1.4 Contribution and Impact
The purpose of this research study is to focus on the unusual aspects of the NCR housing market, as well as the characteristics of the market that might be of interest to policy makers.  Hence an attempt is made to explain why house prices have not exhibited the same boom and bust cycle in recent years, and why the homeownership rate remains low. Among other things, the study has focused on the lending practices of NCR banks, which require a (20-30) % down payment when purchasing a property. Also, the Asset Based Model can be used in NCR in assessing the value of the collateral, thus banks have much information Housing Finance, Prices, and Tenure in NCR relative to the fair value of a property when granting a loan. 

In short:This study investigates the value of housing, which is a specific group of investment assets, in particular the primary valuation drivers of the NCR housingprice, by using Asset Based Model. 

The main contribution of the Model will be helping in understanding the primary valuation drivers of housing prices will make market participants aware of the size of their risk exposure and can help them to detect early signals of the possibility of investment opportunities. Furthermore, policymakers can use information about the underlying valuation drivers of the house prices to stabilize the market.

2.0 Literature Review

2.0.0 Indian Housing Industry-Pricing Models
Real estate companies in India must improve their condition so that their market share can be improved in this huge competitive environment. The approach which is required is the insights of research into market demand, micro and macro-economic market factors and the study of past sales of sites in a given location. These insights can give an accurate and predictive road map of where the market is headed

According to experts tracking the realty sector, sites such as Magicbricks.com, 99acres.com, Makaan.com, IndiaProperty.com and Common Floor.com are fast becoming the choice of consumers looking for renting a property, as well as for developers. The online real estate market is yet to reach an inflection point as seen in the travel or e-commerce sector. However, with the penetration of the internet, more and more consumers in the urban areas have started using this medium as the first point of search for all their real estate needs. In changing real estate and construction market, the old thumb rules used by industry specialist sometimes stops being valid. There is a fundamental shift in the market rules. Sometimes the investments involved in the industry are very high and these investments are built on speculation. It is very valuable to collect data on the market dynamics in a scientific manner to reduce risk.

Among asset markets, the most heavily researched is the equity market. Two examples include Fama and French (1988) and Poterba and Summers (1988). Using different methodologies both studies find significant evidence of mean reversion at long horizons. For example, Fama and French conclude that “predictable variation is estimated to be about 40 percent of 3-5-year return variances for portfolios of small firms.Schiffman and Kanuk (2010) mentioned that consumer behavior is ‘the behavior that consumers display in searching for purchasing, using, evaluating and disposing of product, service and idea which they expect will satisfy their needs’. Study of decision-making process in buyer behavior has attracted many researchers. It dug upon developing and understanding a logic as to how purchasers exercise their choice between two or more alternative products. Researchers try to understand the stages through which consumers pass when deciding which products or services to purchase and their behavior after that choice. These matters have been extensively investigated over many years by marketers, including Howard and Sheth (1969), Engel et al. (2005), Mowen (1995), Peter and Olson (2001) and Hoyer and MacInnis (1997). Kotler and Amstrong (2005), Mowen (1995) and Engel et al. (2005) suggest that there is a generic decision-making process. Rossi (1980), Law and Warnes (1982) and Livette (2006) have used the same model of decision-making process for evaluating housing options. Many attempts have been made to identify factors that influence the buyer behaviour for residential apartments. The features of the apartment structure itself will be an important determinant of a household choice of residence (Quigley, 1976). Neighborhood quality, local public services and quantity of housing services also affect the choice of residence (Friedman, 1980; Gabriel and Rosenthal, 1989; Hua Kiefer, 2007). Nechyba and Strauss (1997) found that public expenditures, tax, crime rate, commercial activity are factors influencing buying decisions. Connie and Fernando (2001) considered the effects of factors on residential development in PT Delta, Comoro Permai, Dilly as a case study. 

They included following 20 factors that might influence buying behavior of a residential dwelling unit: Building Quality, Design, Price, Building area, Land area, Affordable down payment, Interest Rate, Payment Period, Clean, Safe, Aesthetic, Electricity, Water, Telephone, Linkage to the Working Place, Accessibility to the Market, Short Distance to the School, Place for Worship, Sport Facilities, Investment and Public Transport.

Since the housing share moves slowly, a concern with composition risk induces low-frequency movements in stock prices that are not driven by news about cash flow. Moreover, the model predicts that the housing share can be used to forecast excess returns on stocks. 

Kanojia, Magar and Jadhav (2016) states in his research paper Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) is used for estimating the value of a commodity or the demand for a commodity. The method has been widely used in real estate and housing market research in the recent past. In this report, Estimation of residential market price by Hedonic Pricing Method due to environmental service is discussed. Environmental services are a concept from the ecological economics literature. Environmental services refer to qualitative functions of natural non produced assets of land, water and air (including related ecosystem) and their biota, which implies natural environment providing particularly important uses or benefits that can be captured under the concept of “services.” It undertakes an examination of the use of this methodology in the recent real estate and housing literature in the preparation of housing predictive model. 

The problem is that the real estate sector in India has a massive information irregularity, the companies have all the information and there is no means to confirm if the information they are displaying out is correct. 

2.0.1Statement of Problem
By studying above research work it can be interpreted that there is fair amount of work which has been done to identify the parameters of real estate, but as pointed precisely by the researcher (Prashant Das et al, 2013) the gist of which is the information provided to the end user is not accurate, hence at the same time by looking at current trend of real estate market there is no denial of the fact that many newly launched real estate projects in good locations are losing out on sales because of faulty marketing vision. In this project we will try to scientifically study the effect of various determinant on the final price of the housing, and hence as a resulthelping developer segment out the niche market for developing customized marketing strategy for each market segment and as a result helping the end user with well-informed decision which will certainly help the real estate industry to grow.

3.0 Research Methodology
Research in common parlance refers to a search for knowledge. Research is an art of scientific investigation. The Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English lays down the meaning of research as "a careful investigation or enquiry especially through search for new facts in any branch of knowledge." Research is, thus, an original contribution to the existing stock of knowledge making for its advancement. Further, it is a systematic search for getting answers to our problems or questions. The answer is from the knowledge.
It is the pursuit of truth with the help of study, observation, comparison and experiment. In short, the search for knowledge through an objective and systematic method of finding a solution to a problem is Research.
3.0.0 RESEARCH APPROACH  

The research approach for this study had been Quantitative research that is explaining the phenomena by collecting numerical data that are analyzed based on Statistical Learning System methods (Multiple Linear Regression). The reason why Quantitative research has been used as the study is designed Asset Based Housing Model. 

3.0.1 RESEARCH DESIGN

The Research Design used in this study isCross-sectionally used for non-experimental Exploratory Research. Generally speaking, these studies are carried on a large sample population at a single point of time, seeks to describe the Mathematical relationships between the constructs (dependent and independent variables).

3.0.2 BASIC THEORY OF MULTIPLE REGRESSIONS
Regression is usually introduced in connection with the theory of correlation, but it is, in reality, a more general, and, in some respects a simpler idea and the regression coefficients are of interest and scientific importance in many classes of data where the correlation coefficient, if used at all, is an artificial concept of no real utility. In many applications, there is more than one factor that influences the response. Multiple regression models thus describe how a single response variable Y depends linearly on several predictor variables.
3.0.3 DATA COLLECTION (RESEARCH INSTRUMENT)
In all research problems, it is often found that data at hand (published sources) are inadequate, and hence, it becomes necessary to collect data that are appropriate (fresh, update and study-related). Data were collected through self-administeredstructured questionnaire uploaded through Google doc, and the data was captured by collecting information from different Real Estate Agents in NCR namely Gurgaon, Delhi, Noida, and Faridabad. Further, the importance of their input will also be guaranteed confidentiality and anonymity.

3.0.5 SAMPLING PLAN  
The sampling technique used in this Research is Convenient Sampling Technique. We have selected the observations (records) from the collected database, using the following inclusion criteria:
•	Buyers or Investors buying high-valued properties. 
•	The property used for analysis was mostly ready to move properties.
Therefore, the target population will be a mix of the Potential Buyers or Property Investors of the NCR regions. 

3.0.6(a) CRISP-DM MODEL FOR DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION 

The typical CRISP Model (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) of a defined framework would be followed for making an informed decision, and therefore the Statistical Learning life cycle would have the following Project Phases in Data Analysis. 

 
3.0.6(b)Data Acquisition:This step refers to Data Storage. In our research study, we would store the data in MS-Excel worksheet, so that the data can be cleaned and validated easily. Also, the dataset is not too large to be stored in any DBMS.
3.0.7 LIMITATION OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY AND ANALYSIS 
Statistical Models are based on probabilities and though it uses the techniques of mathematical science. Yet, the results and conclusions drawn are not assumed to be very accurate. Therefore, the study is not a complete solution to any marketing issue as there are many dominant variables between research conclusions and market response. In short: It provides only probable, complex, and abstract solutions whereas traditional management expects simple and concretesolutions.

DATA PREPARATION	EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 	MODEL BUILDING 	MODEL EVAULATION WITH RESPECT TO COCHRAN ASSET BASED PRICING 
DATA ACQUISITION 	SPLITTING THE MASTER DATASET 			
Data stored in the MS-Excel is transformed in csv format.	The master dataset is divided into two datasets: Study Population and Analysis  	The Analysis data variables are explored,by descriptive statistics, the structure of the variables, along with their names
	The Linear Regression Model is obtained by using the Stepwise Regression Method.AIC is used to estimate the prediction accuracy of the model,and the criterion being the smallest AIC. 	The Regression Models is evaluated to find the dependency of Payoffs to Price.
The master dataset is imported in R environment.
		The Analysis Variables are then plotted visually for better representation.	The R-Square and Adjusted R-Square is taken into account. A minimum benchmark of 0.50 is taken for the Model to be accepted.	
The master dataset is cleaning of any missing values, and it was deleted if any.
	The Study dataset is checked.
		Diagnostic Plots are plotted to understand the residuals, and differences between the actual and the predicted.	
The master dataset was then transformed into a data frame.
	The Analysis of dataset is checked.
		The correlation among the dependent variables is evaluated by plotting the correlation plots.	
Finally, the master dataset was listed.
	Converting the variables into factors in the Study Population. 
			
The master dataset is checked
	Checking again the Study Population dataset.
			
	Plotting the Study dataset variables.			

4.0.4 STATSITICAL MODEL OF THE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

In this Statistical Study, the Y is the indicative price, or say the dependent (target) variable; that is supposed to linearly dependent to other explanatory variables (location, purchase year,…….., annual maintenance) say Xi; and therefore we can write as Y= X11+X22+….+Xnn+(error). The 1 ,2 ,…n are the regression coefficient associated with the respective explanatory variables X1, X2, …Xn.

4.0.5STATSITICAL DEFINITION OF THE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

Multiple Linear Regression is an extension (generalization) of simple linear regression. It is one of the most important statistical techniques for business applications. It's a statistical methodology that helps estimate the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables


4.0.6ASSUMPTION OF THE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

•	Linearity: A linear relationship is assumed between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
•	 Normality of Residuals: Regression residuals (predicted minus observed values) must be normally distributed.
•	Equality of Residual Variance: When an independent variable is defined by group membership, then the assumption implies that the variance within each group is the same. Hence, in ANOVA terminology, the assumption is also called the homogeneity of variance assumption.
•	Fixed Independent Variables: In Regression, we assume fixed-effect independent variables model. 
•	Absence of Multi-Collinearity: Absence of multi-collinearityis assumed in the model, meaning that the independent variables are not too highly correlated.
4.0.7STATSITICAL RATIONALE

This is a predictive data mining problem, and the Multiple Linear Regression has been performed to determine the relative influence of independent (or predictor variables) on the dependent (target) variable, in a mathematical equation form. This model assumes an additive function relating a dependent (target) variable to a set of predictors (independent) variables.

DATA ANALYSIS 

The statistical analysis of this study is done by a two-step process: 
Exploratory Data Analysis: This includes the process of loading the data in R environment, cleaning, preprocessing, computing the descriptive statistics and plotting for the graphical presentation. 

Model Development and Evaluation: This section contains discussions on the model, criteria for selection, and interpretation of the relevant regression parameters.

The Regression Model by Simple Method as we have obtained is as follows:

Y (Price-Indicative) = -0.324+0.004(Location)-0.004(Property type)-0.0005(Carpet Area)-0.01(Year of Purchase)-0.010 (Period of Lease) +0.001(Category of Property) +0.22(Payoffs) +0.002(Maintenance Amount)-0.001(Percentage of Rental Increment) +0.03(Availability of Social Infra-structure) +0.005(Property Purchased: Loan/ Cash)

STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE OF STEP-WISE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

When selecting the model for the multiple linear regression analysis, another important consideration is the model fit.  Adding independent variables to a multiple linear regression model will always increase the amount of explained variance in the dependent variable (typically expressed as R²).  Therefore, adding too many independent variables without any theoretical justification may result in an over-fit model, in poor out-of-sample forecasts. Many formal statistical criteria have been proposed to formalize the trade-off between fit and parsimony. The best-known and most popular one is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) .The function step () uses the Akaike Information Criterion to perform Step-wise Regression Model search. However, the search uses backward elimination by default.

4.10COMPARISON OF THE REGRESSION MODELS 

Comparing the two regression models, namely the simple Multiple Regression and the Stepwise Regression Model, we see that the removal of the other predictors has not significantly affected the explanatory ability of the model.
Statistical Parameters 	Model 1(SIMPLE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION)	Model 2(STEP-WISE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION)	CRITERION
The residuals (i.e., the errors) of the fit of the linear model to the used data should be as small as possible.	0.5062	0.5057	Smaller the better.
Diagnostics information outputted by R.
The adjusted coefficient is more demanding as it takes into account the number of parameters of the regression model.
	0.4502	0.451	Higher the better.
R2 coefficients (multiple and adjusted). The adjusted coefficient is more demanding as it takes into account the number of parameters of the regression model
	0.449	0.4478	Higher the better. 

RESIDUAL VS FITTED VALUES PLOT

Ideally, this plot shouldn't show any pattern. As we see no shape (curve, U shape), it suggests linearity in the dataset. 

 

NORMALITY Q-Q PLOT

As the name suggests, this plot is used to determine the normal distribution of errors. It uses standardized values of residuals. Ideally, this plot should show a straight line, which is showing in our case, and therefore we can conclude that the error follows normal distribution. 






 



SCALE-LOCATION

It's also called Spread-Location plot. This plot shows if residuals are spread equally along with the ranges of predictors. This is how we can check the assumption of equal variance (homoscedasticity). Here we see a horizontal line with equally (randomly) spread points. 





 


RESIDUALS VS LEVERAGE

This plot helps us to find influential cases (i.e., subjects) if any. Not all outliers are influential in linear regression analysis (whatever outliers mean). Even though data have extreme values, they might not be influential to determine a regression line. That means, the results wouldn’t be much different if we either include or exclude them from analysis. They follow the trend in the majority of cases and they don’t really matter; they are not influential. 

Unlike the other plots, this time patterns are not relevant. We watch out for outlying values at the upper right corner or at the lower right corner. Those spots are the places where cases can be influential against a regression line. Look for cases outside of a dashed line, Cook’s distance. When cases are outside of the Cook’s distance (meaning they have high Cook’s distance scores), the cases are influential to the regression results. The regression results will be altered if we exclude those cases.

 


4.11 CORRELATION PLOT TO EVALUATE THE HOUSE PRICE ON ASSET BASED MODEL 


To suggest the Asset Based Modeling, it is essential to initial feel for the relationships between the independent variables- and, in particular, Carpet Area (size of the property), Leasing Period, and the Annual Maintenance Cost.  It is interesting to observe the correlation plots produced by plotting it clearly emerges that the Price is assumed as Financial Instrument, generating recurring returns seems to be mostly correlated to the Annual Maintenance charges, and has to be negatively correlated with the Leasing Period (lower the charges as the leasing period increases), and yes the Price has to be proportionate to the size (carpet area). However, the regression analysis is to investigate the significance and magnitude of this possible effect.


 



From the above plots, we understand that the robustness of the model assumptions is met, and therefore, it is safe to assume that the obtained model is relatively sound.


 
The table below gives the predicted values of the Model in terms of crore.

4.12 Few Basic terms of Asset Based Modelling

Asset Definition: An asset is any resource owned by the business. Anything tangible or intangible that can be owned or controlled to produce value and that is held by an entity to produce positive economic value is an asset

Asset-Based Modeling: The principle underlying an asset-based approach to welfare is that, rather than relying on state-managed social transfers to counter the risks of poverty, individuals accept greater responsibility for their own welfare needs by investing in financial products and property assets which augment in value over time. 

Cochrane Asset Based Model: An investor who thinks about how much to save and consume, and what portfolio of assets to hold. The most basic pricing equation comes from the first-order conditions to that problem and says that price should be the expected discounted payoff, using the investor’s marginal utility to discount the payoff.  Asset pricing theory all stems from one simple concept: price equals expected discounted payoff (rent). The model assumes an association among user cost UCt, the house selling prices, Pt, and the rents Rt
Rt/ Pt=UCt

If the rent-to-price ratio exceeds the user-cost rate, renting becomes less attractive than ownership. When the rents equal the costs of owning a state of equilibrium is reached. This rent-to-price relationship fits well in markets where the rental regulation is absent or limited.

5.0 Results

This study investigates the value of housing,a specific group of investment assets, in particular, the primary valuation drivers of the NCR housing stocks, by employing the Cochrane Econometrics Model. 
The study dataset has 2 BHK as the Model Property, Gurgaon as the Model Location, 2017 as the Model Year, the Model numbers of years the people want their property to be leased is (11-15), majority purchased are in cash,  and majority have the social infra-structure in their vicinity, which in general comprise of school, hospital, pharmacy, Children Park, etc. 
The statistical perspective was to evaluate the relationship of Price (customer willing to pay) and its relationship with payoff (monthly rental income), and the deductions such as annual maintenance cost. To begin with, we have outlined twelve (12) variables. Statistically speaking too many independent variables without any theoretical justification may result in an over-fit model, in poor out-of-sample forecasts. We, therefore, have resorted to Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression, which is a formal statistical criterion which has been proposed to formalize the trade-off between fit and parsimony. The best-known and most popular one is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The function stepwise regression is used using the Akaike Information Criterion to search best performing Regression Model. However, the search uses backward elimination by default.

After correlation plots has been produced, Price has clearly emerged as financial instruments. And generating recurring returns seems to be most correlated to the Annual Maintenance charges and is negatively correlated with the Leasing Period (lower the charges as the leasing period increases).Price(dependent-variable) is proportionate to the size carpet area.
Further, this study shows that there has been a significant relationship between housing prices and the expected payoff (rent) in NCR housing stock. It also appears that there is a positive linear relationship between housing prices and year of purchase, the size of the property. Understanding the interaction between housing prices and the rental payoff is of importance since the interdependence is likely to augment boom-bust cycles in the housing economy

6.0 Conclusion and Future Scope

The asset-based model will help in understanding the primary valuation drivers of housing prices and will make market participants aware of the size of their risk exposure and can help them to detect early signals of the possibility of investment opportunities. Furthermore, policymakers can use information about the underlying valuation drivers of the house prices to stabilize the market. Direct housing investment has some typical disadvantage such as poor liquidity and difficult to evaluate.
one of the several marketing issue individuals in real estate business generally commit is that they didn’t remain up to date and they use one-prong strategy (via referrals). With the help of this study, it can help marketing professionals to remain up to date with latest trends in marketing field and they can apply multi-prong strategies like website designing with accurate data information, holding open house etc.
As, from the perspective of homebuyers with the availability of accurate information and data, it becomes quite easy to analyze, compare and take the effective and well-formed decision.
Lastly, we would like to end by quoting Kendall and Stuart, “A statistical relationship, however strong and however suggestive, can never establish causal connection: our ideas of causation must come from outside statistics, ultimately from some theory or other.”
